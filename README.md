In our dorm, every student must know four things (every day all day) if he wants to survive:

- What food is there and how disgusting it is.
- Is the rabbi now going to dorm.
- Is the manager downstairs.
- Is there a roll call now.

With the help of the app we developed each student will be able to tweet on his own and watch other tweets pertaining to the above list.

You can also report a wrong tweet :poop: or check "Like" :thumbsup:.
