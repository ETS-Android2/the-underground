# The Underground

![](https://github.com/itsikshteinberger/the-underground/blob/master/FinalProject/app/src/main/res/drawable/Drawing-4.sketchpad.png)

In our dorm, every student must know four things (every day all day) if he wants to survive:

- What food is there and how disgusting it is:vomiting_face:.
- Is the rabbi now going to dorm:warning:.
- Is the manager downstairs:rotating_light:.
- Is there a rollcall now:heavy_check_mark:.

With the help of the app we developed each student will be able to tweet on his own and watch other tweets pertaining to the above list:sunglasses:.

You can also report a wrong tweet :poop: or check "Like" :thumbsup:.

Have fun and be careful!

# Installation

To install the app, download the [the-underground.apk](https://github.com/itsikshteinberger/the-underground/blob/master/FinalProject/the-underground.apk) file to your phone.

In order to run the application on your machine, make sure that you have "Android Studio" and an active connection to RealTimeDataBase in a Firebase server (note that you will not be able to connect to the original server for security reasons, but you can run on your own dummy server :))

# User manual

Okay, now we've got to the fun part.

If you are staying in our dorm as of 2021 - you must enter your ID number and choose a password - remember the password! It will be used by you next time.

In the bottom navigation bar you are about to see three icons and I am going to explain to you about them all:

**The home button :house_with_garden:**

On the home page you can be updated with your friends' tweets and even give them a "Like" or "Troll" depending on the credibility of the tweet.
Just do not be a jerk! Bring "Like" or "Troll" to the people who deserve it.

There are four buttons on the tweet page - be careful not to click on them for no reason - it will send a tweet.

Button with a hat icon - report the manager here.

Button with food icon - report that food has arrived (you can also rate the food and describe the food)
Button with check list icon - report rollcall.
