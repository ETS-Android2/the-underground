# The Underground

In our dorm, every student must know four things (every day all day) if he wants to survive:

- What food is there and how disgusting it is:vomiting_face:.
- Is the rabbi now going to dorm:warning:.
- Is the manager downstairs:rotating_light:.
- Is there a roll call now:heavy_check_mark:.

With the help of the app we developed each student will be able to tweet on his own and watch other tweets pertaining to the above list:sunglasses:.

You can also report a wrong tweet :poop: or check "Like" :thumbsup:.

Have fun and be careful!
